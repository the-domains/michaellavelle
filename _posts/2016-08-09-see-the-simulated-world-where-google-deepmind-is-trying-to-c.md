  Padded walls, gloomy lighting, and a ceiling with floral wallpaper. It doesn't
  look like a place to make groundbreaking discoveries that change the
  trajectory of society. But in these simulated, claustrophobic corridors, Demis

  solve humanity's biggest problems. "Our goal's very big," says Hassabis, whose
  level-headed manner can mask the audacity of his ideas.
